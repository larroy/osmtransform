Design
======

For each feature, calculate level into which the feature will be available. Then compute the list of
quadkeys of the quads that the feature's bounding box will intersect.

Then we can simplify the geometry and insert a simplified object in the required quad.

Simplify.

Clip.

HGT File Format

HGT files can be read and converted to other DEM formats by 3dem.

An HGT file covers an area of 1°x1°. Its south western corner can be deduced from its file name: for
example, n51e002.hgt covers the area between N 51° E 2° and N 52° E 3°, and s14w077.hgt covers S 14°
W 77° to S 13° W 76°. The fils size depends on the resolution. If this is 1", there are 3601 rows of
3601 cells each; if it is 3", there are 1201 rows of 1201 cells each. The rows are laid out like
text on a page, starting with the northernmost row, with each row reading from west to east. Each
cell has two bytes, and the elevation at that cell is 256*(1st byte) + (2nd byte). It follows that a
3" HGT file has a file length of 2 x 1201 x 1201. SRTM 3" cells are calculated by calculating the
mean of 1" cells and their eight neighbors. It follows that the highest local point is likely to
higher than the highest SRTM 3" cell. The difference should vary with the steepness of the local
relief.
